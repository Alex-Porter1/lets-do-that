-Created models for Activity, Category, Rating
-Registered the models to the admin
-Created view for the to GET, POST Activities
-Created url path for Activity view
-Created common folder inside of Activities_rest, with a json.py file
-Created the model encoders inside of that json.py file

Will need to probably make adjustments with the Rating model/how it's implemented. Would rather have users be able to rate activities, rather than create ratings and apply them to the activities.

Was surprised to find how much I recalled when creating models, views. I thought after a little time away from not doing them, I would be really confused. But, I retained more than I realized.
