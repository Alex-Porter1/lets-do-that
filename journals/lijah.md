* Today I learned that when using a custom user model
## August 30, 2022

* Paired with Joel and Alex to today to work through the last of the authentication.
* We needed to implement high order functions to handle logging in and out as well as associating an account with token to gain access to our protected pages.

* Today I learned that the issue we were having on the backend with creating a user was related to an extra field being on our model. After commenting it out we were able to quickly create a new user.

* Alex and I collaborated in making the React components for the login and signup pages.
* We're still having trouble getting the authentication to work and will get help from Joel tomorrow with it.

* Today I learned the "float-end" property for bootstrap will align the div to the right side, which we used on our login and signup form to create a link between the two pages utilizing the Link component in React.

* Alex and I paired and started working on the authentication for signing up and logging in into our app.
* We ran into some merging conflicts and had to reach out to a SEIR in order to fix them.
* We finished setting up the Postgres database in the process.
* We also setup our Account class to take advantage of Django's AbstractUser class.
* We ran into some serious errors when trying to create a user on the backend, we will be building pages on the frontend to test our authentication.

* Today I learned that the Postgres database login information was generated by a script in our relational database folder and that the account name there needed to be filled into our database url in the environment of our microservices.

* Changes to accounts poller, model and encoder to reflect update to rating in activities.
* Worked on how to authenticate sign in and sign up for for our app.

* Today I learned a lot about django authentication and the different built in tools that can be used to verify a user.

* Created delete and get individual account view and got poller up and running to get activity data from activities microservice.

* Paired with Alex to work through some errors I was having in the poller. Through that I learned more about how the yaml file is setup and where the names for microservices can be used, how to make sure I have the correct port setup and where to us directory navigation for the volumes in the poller.

Today I worked on:

* Creating the models, list and create views for the Accounts microservice.

* I wrote the models based on the Excalidraw domain model and tested the list view using Insomnia. Will need to coordinate with the team tomorrow to access Activity model's data in order to test the create view.

* Today I found out I can hold the option key to highlight the properties on the model. This made creating model specific encoders much easier, because I could copy, paste and then format it correctly. I look forward to using this in the future.
