* Created delete and get individual account view and got poller up and running to get activity data from activities microservice.
* Paired with Alex to work through some errors I was having in the poller. Through that I learned more about how the yaml file is setup and where the names for microservices can be used, how to make sure I have the correct port setup and where to us directory navigation for the volumes in the poller.

Today I worked on:

* Creating the models, list and create views for the Accounts microservice.

I wrote the models based on the Excalidraw domain model and tested the list view using Insomnia. Will need to coordinate with the team tomorrow to access Activity model's data in order to test the create view.

Today I found out I can hold the option key to highlight the properties on the model. This made creating model specific encoders much easier, because I could copy, paste and then format it correctly. I look forward to using this in the future.
