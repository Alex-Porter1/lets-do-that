Today I worked on:

* Our team met up and we consulted Andrew on our project to make sure the scope of it was enough. We decided to start simple and add on to it as we went along. We mapped out what we wanted the layout of it to look like in terms of the main page, login page, detail page. We also went over the Docker Setup together and had Joel push it up to main. We have decided to use git to add issues and have different people complete each task.
