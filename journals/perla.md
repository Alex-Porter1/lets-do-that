Today I worked on:

* Still working on CSS and bootstrap. Tried a few pre-made templates that gave me lots of trouble.

* The template I picked would not load and couldn't figure out the bugs. Consulted a SEIR and they informed me I picked a template that was html based. So back to the drawing board with the template.

Today I worked on:

* Our group talked about how to divide responsibilities. I expressed interest in working on the activities portion of it. We are also going to go through the list of issues on git to continue working on the project.

Today I worked on:

* Our team met up and we consulted Andrew on our project to make sure the scope of it was enough. We decided to start simple and add on to it as we went along. We mapped out what we wanted the layout of it to look like in terms of the main page, login page, detail page. We also went over the Docker Setup together and had Joel push it up to main. We have decided to use git to add issues and have different people complete each task.
