## Initial Feedback 

### Project idea
This is an interesting idea with plenty of potential features. From a business perspective have you all given any thought to how you would grow your user base to an initial critical mass that is needed for a social network to work? This isn't necessary for the project or demo, but would show that you've given thought to business considerations as well as the technical aspects.

### Scope of work
The overall functionality looks reasonable in scope, but you need to figure out which features are absolutely necessary for your MVP and which can be stretch goals. Please setup a meeting with Andrew or I to discuss if you need any help distilling/identifying the MVP.

### Docs
The start on your docs looks good. For your benefit, keep those up-to date as you make decisions and refine your designs. Use your `integrations.md` file to keep track of any useful information that you find about setting-up and configuring the integrations. These can be a pain to figure out sometimes, document it so it is easy for your other team members and for you later when you forget... If you all use these docs as THE place that you put any and all documentation about your project, it will be easier for you all to stay on the same page.

I suggest that you create wireframes of your pages before you start creating them.
