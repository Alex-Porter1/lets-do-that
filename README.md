This application will be used for planning dates/activities, both solo and with friends, based on what the user and their friends/dates are interested in.

## Intended Market

We expect this app to be used by the general population since people of all ages enjoy doing activities.
Specifically, we are targeting smartphone users who tend to be in a younger demographic as they tend to utilize apps more often for dating and hanging out with friends.

## Functionality

* Users can create a profile with login/logout functionality.
* Users will answer prompts when they open the app to filter out activities. / Or button click "New activity"
    * Prompts - rate them 1 - 5, and based on that we suggest activities
* Once they complete the prompts, suggestion of activities that fit their answers will be displayed.
    * User will then choose an activity to do from the choices presetned.
* Users can invite other users to join them on their activities.
* User can have favorites list on their profile
* Users can rate activities.
* Users can create activities that show up in prompts.
