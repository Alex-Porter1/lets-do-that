This application will be used for finding dates/activities in the moment, both solo and with friends, based on what the user is interested in. We will use Django for the backend, React for  the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database.

## Intended Market

We expect this app to be used by the general population since people of all ages enjoy doing activities.
Specifically, we are targeting smartphone users who tend to be in a younger demographic as they tend to utilize apps more often for dating and hanging out with friends.

## Functionality

* Users can create a profile with login/logout/signup functionality.
* USer will be able to view their profile page with their basic information.
* Users will select primary categories when they open the app to filter out activities.
* Once primary category is selected, suggestion of activities that fit their selection will be displayed.
  * User will then choose an activity to do from the choices presented.
  * User will then be navigated to a page that will display details about the activity chosen.
